## CASCADE: Calibrated Inference of Spiking from Calcium Imaging Data


### What is CASCADE?
Embedded image of spike prediction

Easy-to-install and -use

Link to preprint / paper

### Installation and first steps

1. No installation: Colab Notebook

2. Local installation

##### Colab Notebook
What this is for. Limitations of this approach. Describe example use case.

##### Local installation
Describe that using CASCADE does not require powerful GPUs.

Installation procedure with pip and/or by cloning the repository.

Describe the main dependencies (anaconda; keras with tensorflow, yaml).

For developers who want to train their own models or who want to systematically study the algorithm, we recommend GPU-based deep learning frameworks. Provide a link to a tutorial on how to set this up (e.g., DeepLabCut tutorial).


### Typical work flow

Describe data format for inputs and functions that read the data. 

Describe output data format and how it can be interpreted correctly. 

Describe the main functions used for predictions, together with the identifier for each model.

### How it works ...

Describe ground truth datasets, how they are resampled. 

Provide a lot of references to key figures and sections in the paper, how predictions generalize; single-spike precision; etc.

### Under the hood

Describe the main methods, how they use functions in the utils-folders and what they do.

Describe where the neural network is defined, etc. pp.
